            <h2 id="storyTitle">BOOBAHS</h2>
            <p class="storyParagraph" id="SP1">
                They arrived on Earth, travelling around the globe while leaving no trace of their existence. 
                After the collapse of their home planet, the Boobahs had to find another suitable habitat to thrive. 
                Any obstacles that interfere with their goal will be brought down no matter what. The first plan of the Boobahs in Earth
                was to increase the global temperatures to mimic their former planet. Lobbying under private business that support oil companies
                while assisting with destroying the earth's ecosystems to replace with their own. Humans have already been doing these atrocities and the Boobahs didn't have to do more.
                The Boobah's next goal is to eliminate the apex predator of Earth.
            </p>
            <p class="storyParagraph" id="SP2">
                First they infiltrated the entertainment sector in 2004, showing their true form to the public. Then they implanted their AI technologies in big tech companies, ramping
                progress into automating every task a human has done by themselves since the start of time. AI became the next big thing of the 21st century, however the Boobah's technology
                allowed them full control of its workings and spread misinformation world wide. It led to increased division of the people in real life and online media sites. While everybody was busy destroying eachother,
                the boobah's took over the minds of the people and ordered them to eliminate others.
            </p>
            <p class="storyParagraph" id="SP3">
                You and your classmates found yourself unaffected by the mass hypnotization from the Boobah's. This immunity won't last long as those who used AI are more suceptible to being controlled.
                It is your responsibility to defeat them one step at a time before you get controlled too. DEFEAT THEM AND SAVE HUMANITY
